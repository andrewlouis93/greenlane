# Initialization

- The api requires mongodb set up. If do have it set up, cd in to the installation directory and run: `mongod`
- If not, follow the instructions here: http://michelebusta.com/the-little-things-5-initialize-a-local-mongo-db/
- Run `npm install` in the **frontend** and **api** directories.

# Running this application
- In the **api** directory, run: `node app.js`
- In a new tab, go to the **frontend** directory and run: `grunt`
- (Must have grunt installed globally like so: `npm install -g grunt`!)
